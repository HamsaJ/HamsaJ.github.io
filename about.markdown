Hi, I'm a senior engineer based in London with over 8 years of experience in the field. I have a passion for coding and have worked with several programming languages throughout my career.

As a husband and a father, my family is my top priority and I strive to balance my work and personal life effectively. In my free time, I enjoy engaging in various activities that challenge me and help me to unwind.

One of my greatest interests is reading, which helps me to stay informed about the latest advancements in the tech industry and provides me with a sense of escapism from the daily routine. I am also an avid cyclist and enjoy hitting the roads on my bike whenever I get a chance.

Recently, I have started exploring the world of 3D printing and find it to be a fascinating and creative outlet. I am constantly learning and finding new ways to incorporate this technology into my projects.

Overall, I am a driven and dedicated individual who is always looking to expand my knowledge and skillset. Whether it's through coding, reading, or trying new things, I am always pushing myself to grow and improve.
