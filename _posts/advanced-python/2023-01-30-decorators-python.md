# Decorators and Closures

Decorators and closures are two advanced features of Python that allow developers to modify the behaviour of existing functions and classes in a clean and reusable way. They are often used in conjunction with each other, but they have distinct functionality and use cases. In this article, we will explore decorators and closures in depth and look at how they can be used to improve your code.

### Decorators

A decorator is a function that takes another function as its argument, performs some operations on it, and returns it. It is typically used to add functionality to an existing function without modifying its code. In Python, decorators are defined using the `@` symbol, followed by the name of the decorator function. For example, the following code defines a simple decorator that prints the execution time of a function:

```python
import time

def timer(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end = time.time()
        print(f"Executed in {end - start} seconds")
        return result
    return wrapper

@timer
def my_function():
    time.sleep(1)

my_function() # Output: Executed in 1.0008859634399414 seconds
```

In this example, the `timer` function is a decorator that takes the `my_function` function as its argument. It defines a new function called `wrapper` which will be used to execute the original function. The `wrapper` function prints the execution time of the function and returns the result of its execution. The `@timer` syntax is used to apply the decorator to the `my_function` function.

It's important to note that when the decorator is applied to a function, a new function object is created and the original function is replaced by this new function object.

Decorators can also take arguments, which allows for even more flexibility and reuse. For example, the following decorator takes an argument to specify the number of times the decorated function should be executed:

```python
def repeat(num):
    def decorator(func):
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            for i in range(num):
                result = func(*args, **kwargs)
            return result
        return wrapper
    return decorator

@repeat(num=3)
def my_function():
    print("Hello World")

my_function() # Output: Hello World
             #         Hello World
             #         Hello World
```

In this example, the decorator `repeat` takes an argument `num` and returns another decorator function `decorator` which takes the function to be decorated as an argument. The `decorator` function defines a new function `wrapper` that will execute the original function `num` times, and returns the result of the execution. The `@repeat(num=3)` syntax is used to apply the decorator with the argument to the `my_function` function.

### Closures

A closure is a function object that remembers values in the enclosing scope even if they are not present in memory. In other words, it "closes over" the values from the enclosing scope. Closures are used in conjunction with decorators to provide data encapsulation and maintain state between function calls.

For example, the following closure function takes a number as an argument and returns a function that adds that number to its argument:

```python
def adder(x):
    def add(y):
        return x + y
    return add

add5 = adder(5)
print(add5(3)) # Output: 8
print(add5(4)) # Output: 9
```

In this example, the `adder` function takes a number `x` as an argument and returns a new function `add`. The `add` function has access to the value of `x` from the enclosing scope, even though it is not passed as an argument. This allows the `add` function to "remember" the value of `x` and use it in subsequent function calls.

Closures can also be used in decorators to maintain state between function calls. For example, the following closure decorator counts the number of times a function has been called:

```python
def counter(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        wrapper.count += 1
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        print(f"{func.__name__} has been called {wrapper.count} times.")
        return result
    wrapper.count = 0
    return wrapper

@counter
def my_function():
    pass

my_function() # Output: my_function has been called 1 times.
my_function() # Output: my_function has been called 2 times.
```

In this example, the `counter` decorator defines a new function `wrapper` that has an additional attribute `count` to keep track of the number of times the original function has been called. The `wrapper.count` attribute is initialized to 0 and is incremented every time the function is called. The `wrapper` function also prints the number of times the original function has been called before returning the result.

### Conclusion

Decorators and closures are powerful features of Python that allow developers to modify the behavior of existing functions and classes in a clean and reusable way. Decorators can be used to add functionality to existing functions without modifying their code, while closures can be used to maintain state between function calls. When used together, decorators and closures can greatly improve the design and maintainability of your code.

It's important to note that decorators and closures can make your code more complex and harder to understand if used improperly. It's important to use them judiciously and only when they offer a clear advantage over other solutions. Also, when dealing with more complex use cases, it's also important to test your decorators and closures to ensure they are working as intended.
