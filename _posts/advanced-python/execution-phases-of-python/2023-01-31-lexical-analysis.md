# Lexical Analysis

## Lexical Analysis in Python

In the first phase of Python's execution process, also known as lexical analysis, the interpreter reads the source code and converts it into a stream of tokens. These tokens represent the basic elements of the programming language, such as keywords, operators, and identifiers. The lexical analysis phase is crucial for the interpreter to understand the structure and meaning of the code, as well as to identify any syntax errors.

### Internal Steps

The lexical analysis phase in Python can be broken down into the following internal steps:

1. **Reading the source code**: The interpreter begins by reading the source code from the file or input source. It reads the code character by character and starts building the stream of tokens.
2. **Identifying token types**: As the interpreter reads the source code, it uses a set of rules to identify the type of each token. These rules are based on the syntax of the programming language and are defined in the lexical specification. For example, the interpreter can use regular expressions to identify keywords, operators, and identifiers.
3. **Building tokens**: Once the interpreter has identified the type of a token, it creates a new token object and assigns its type and value. The token object contains information such as the type of the token, its value, and its position in the source code.
4. **Adding tokens to the stream**: After building a token, the interpreter adds it to the stream of tokens. The stream is a linear sequence of tokens that represents the source code in a structured form.
5. **Checking for syntax errors**: As the interpreter reads the source code, it checks for any syntax errors. If it finds any errors, it raises an exception and stops the execution process. For example, if the interpreter encounters a character that is not part of the programming language's syntax, it will raise a syntax error.

### Computational Complexity

The computational complexity of the lexical analysis phase depends on the size of the source code and the number of tokens it contains. In the worst-case scenario, where the source code is long and contains many tokens, the complexity is O(n), where n is the number of characters in the source code. This is because the interpreter needs to read and process each character in the source code.

However, in most cases, the complexity is much lower. This is because the number of tokens in the source code is usually much smaller than the number of characters. Additionally, the interpreter can use various optimization techniques to reduce the complexity, such as lookahead and backtracking.

### Optimisation

There are several ways to optimize the lexical analysis phase in Python:

1. **Using a lexer generator**: A lexer generator is a tool that can automatically generate the lexical analysis code based on a set of rules. This can save a lot of time and effort compared to writing the code manually.
2. **Using a pre-tokenized source code**: If the source code is already tokenized, the interpreter can skip the lexical analysis phase and move directly to the next phase. This can significantly reduce the execution time.
3. **Using a cache**: The interpreter can use a cache to store the tokens of the source code, so it doesn't have to re-tokenize the same code multiple times. This can reduce the execution time for frequently executed code.

In conclusion, lexical analysis is the first phase of Python's execution process. It converts the source code into a stream of tokens that represent
