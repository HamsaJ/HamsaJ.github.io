# Parsing

Parsing is the second phase of the execution process in Python, following lexical analysis. The goal of parsing is to take the stream of tokens generated by the lexical analyzer and turn it into a structured representation of the code, known as an abstract syntax tree (AST).

The first step in the parsing process is to create a grammar that defines the syntax of the language. In Python, this grammar is specified using a formal language called Backus-Naur Form (BNF). The BNF grammar for Python is extensive and can be found in the Python documentation.

Once the grammar is defined, a parser can be created using a parser generator such as ANTLR or PLY. These tools take the BNF grammar as input and automatically generate a parser that can recognize the syntax of the language.

The parser begins by reading the first token from the stream of tokens generated by the lexer and using the BNF grammar to determine which production rule to apply. It then reads the next token and repeats the process, building up a tree of nested productions that represents the structure of the code.

When the parser encounters a syntax error, it will raise an exception and the execution of the program will be halted.

The parsing phase has a time complexity of O(n) where n is the number of tokens in the input. This is because the parser must read each token exactly once in order to build the syntax tree. However, in practice, the parse time can be affected by the specific implementation of the parser and the complexity of the grammar.

There are a few ways to optimize the parsing process in Python, one of which is to use a faster parser generator such as Lark or PyParsing. Another approach is to use a pre-compiled parser, such as the one provided by the python standard library `ast` module. It can also be beneficial to use a just-in-time (JIT) compiler to improve the performance of the generated parser at runtime.

In addition, it is also possible to use caching techniques to store the parse tree of a program, so that it doesn't need to be reparsed every time the program is executed.

In conclusion, the parsing phase is a crucial step in the execution process of python programs. It is responsible for creating a structured representation of the code, known as an abstract syntax tree (AST) that is used by the next phase of the execution process, the bytecode generation. Understanding the parsing process, its complexities and optimisation techniques can help developers to improve the performance of their python programs.
